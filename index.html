  <p>The Mitochondria</p>
  <p>Carbohystrates, Proteins, nuclia acids, and lipids</p>
  <p>Amino acids</p>
  <p>A carbohydrate whose molecules consist of a number of sugar molecules</p>
  <p>A polysccraide is </p>
  <p>Cohesion is the process of connecting like molecules with eachother, while adhesion is the bonding of dissimalr molecules</p>
  <p>Atoms are small because their size maximizes the surface area to volume ratio</p>
  <p>Covalant bonding is when </p>
  <p>Molecles with the same chemical name but different structures</p>
  <p>A functional group is a group of atoms in a molecule that are responsible for giving that atom its specific charicertistics</p>
  <p>Saturated fats don't have double bonds and are not liquid at room temp, while unsaturated fats have double bonds and a transbond, and are liquids at room temp.</p>
  <p>The pH scale measures how acidic or basic a solution is. The pH scale goes from 0-14, 0 being the most acidic and 14 being the most basic, 7 is neautral.</p>
  <p>Hydrolysis is a chemical reaction is which a water moleculre breaks chemical bonds</p>
  <p>acidic</p>
  <p>basic</p>
  <p>Prokaryotes are always unicellular, while eukayrotes are often multi-celled.</p>
  <p>The plasma memberane </p>
  <p>Chloestoral is a a lipid and precurser for many steroids</p>
  <p>Glycogen is a polysaccharide of glucose that serives as a form of energy storage.</p>
  <p>DNA and RNA are nucliac acids</p>
  <p>Osmosis isthe process by which molecules of a solvent pass through a memberane from a higehr concerntration to a lower concentration and thus equilizing the solutions in terms of concentartions</p>
